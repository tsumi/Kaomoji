#Kaomoji

A kaomoji cheat sheet extension for Firefox. I like kaomoji, but i'm too lazy to use an online cheat sheet, so i created an extension. Have fun! (￣ω￣)

##Development

You can also run it in a test environment with:

```$ cfx run```

###Edit the kaomoji set

The kaomojis are stored into a JSON file that is generated by ```buildjson.php``` script, you can edit it and then run:

```$ php buildjson.php > data/kaomoji.json```

to recreate the JSON file.
